# BEE COUNTING PROJECT

**ONGOING PROJECT**
<hr>

In the initial stage of this project, a video-capturing setup was not available. To address this limitation, bee images were created using Python scripts. The **TensorFlow bee_dataset** was utilized to obtain the bee images. Background removal techniques were applied to these images, and they were used to generate videos by placing bee images.

To enable the automatic generation of video frames, bounding box annotations were created using scripts.

The **YOLOv8** object detection model was chosen and trained for identifying **Poland** and **non-Poland bees**. 
For efficient object tracking, the **Byte-Track** algorithm was used due to its excellent speed and accuracy.

This project is currently ongoing, and the team is continuously working to improve the bee counting system for greater efficiency and accuracy.
